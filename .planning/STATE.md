# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-06)

**Core value:** A lightweight, visually distinctive window manager that works well on resource-constrained VPS instances via remote desktop -- simple enough for non-programmers to configure, reliable enough for daily use.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — event-loop-modernization

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-07

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 18min
- Total execution time: 0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | - | - |
| 02 | 2 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: P01(14min), P02(22min)
- Trend: Steady
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 14min | 3 tasks | 12 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 22min | 3 tasks | 9 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase ?]: test_raii linked against X11 because inline RAII destructors call XFree* functions
- [Phase ?]: catch_discover_tests PROPERTIES used for Xvfb fixtures instead of post-discovery set_tests_properties
- [Phase 01 P02]: Client::display() moved to public so Border can access it
- [Phase 01 P02]: installCursorOnWindow() added to Manager for Border to set cursor on resize handle
- [Phase 01 P02]: std::vector<XRectangle> replaces custom RectangleList macro in Border.cpp
- [Phase 01 P02]: Shape extension missing produces warning but not fatal exit

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Border/Xft): Xft rendering inside shaped windows is poorly documented; build a PoC first
- Phase 7 (App Scanner): Binary scan heuristics for identifying GUI apps are novel
- Phase 9 (Config GUI): GTK3 performance over SSH X forwarding is unvalidated

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:
